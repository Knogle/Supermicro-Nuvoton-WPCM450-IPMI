Important Note:
	Mounting a non-jffs2 or corrupted-jffs2 mtd partition changes 
    the contents of the flash to make it mountable (make it jffs2). 
	
	mtd0 maps the whole flash region. To avoid accidently mounting
    mtdblock0 and corrupting the flash, mtdblock0 is not created.

    To avoid accidently creating a mtdblock0, this read-only file 
    is provided here
