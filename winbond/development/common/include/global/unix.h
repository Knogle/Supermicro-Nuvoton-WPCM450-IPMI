/** \brief Connect a handler to all signals
 *
 *  This function connects a single handler to all catchable signals.
 *  If desired, you can save all the old handlers, and restore them later
 *  via \ref restore_all_signals.
 *
 *  \param handler Function returning void and taking an int argument.
 *                 This function will be called every time a signal
 *                 is recevied by the program.  The int argument
 *                 will have the value of the signal received when called.
 *  \param old_actions A pointer to an array of sigaction structs used to 
 *                     store the previous signal action data for each signal.
 *                     this should be an array of sigaction structs with \c NSIG
 *                     items, or NULL if you don't want to restore the previous
 *                     signal handlers.
 *
 *  \note The signal handler will stay registered indefinitely - there is no
 *        need to reregister the signal handler every time the handler runs
 *        as with some implementations of the \c signal(2) function.
 *
 *  \note This function registers signal handlers using the \c SA_RESTART
 *  flag.  This means that some system calls that are interrupted by the
 *  handled signal will be restarted automatically.
 *
 *  \warning Please note that there are two signals which cannot be caught
 *  under any circumstances - \c SIGKILL and \c SIGSTOP.
 *
 *  \retval -1 Failure
 *  \retval 0 Success
